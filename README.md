## Trying today
1) Polynomial Regression; - `Done`
2) EDA (Probably);
3) Submit on Kaggle. - `Done`

## What's next? `TODO`
1) Try Decision Trees (Random Forest or XGBoost/Catboost);
2) Grop rows by `unique_id` and sort them by `date` within the group;
3) Create "shifting" window, so the each sale depend on other sales withing the group (check the idea).
